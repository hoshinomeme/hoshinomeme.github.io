     <p>Fighting consumes the mind.If a battle is successful, one loses one's sanity; if a battle is lost or given up, one loses one's sanity; if a raid is lost or given up, one loses half of his sanity; the first surrender or failure of each level does not cost one's sanity.The amount of sanity returned for annihilation battles is determined by the number of devastations. None of the devastations is refunded. If the devastations are less than 100, the sanity returned for failure/retreat is refunded.

     <p>Reason the current version of the game is a little over 6 minutes to recover gradually until reach maximum speed, and if the player has reached or break through the current value reason limit, although not overflow part invalid but rational automatic recovery will temporarily stalled (or through the use of emergency reason small kind/box of agent/liquid to supplement the reason, or the use of source rock to supplement the reason).
    Exercise tickets can be used for rehearsal. 30 tickets will be provided every day.It should be noted that the exercise only makes the player more familiar with the level. For the game itself, it only consumes the exercise coupons and does not gain any items (ordinary level requires 1 entry and raid level requires 3 entry).
